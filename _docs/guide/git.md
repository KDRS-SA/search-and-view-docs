# Introduction

When sharing code, [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is an industry standard. It is a tool that keeps a history of all changes, and helps handling conflicts when multiple people are working on the same project.

We use a Git server which can be found at [maler.kdrs.no](https://maler.kdrs.no/) to store our templates.

This guide will show you how to setup your Git to authenticate with our server, make changes to a template and release an update.
